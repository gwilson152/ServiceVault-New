## üìù Documentation Maintenance

### Critical Requirement: Always Update Documentation

**When making changes to the codebase, updating documentation is NOT optional - it is required.**

#### Update Requirements

**For Code Changes:**
- Update relevant feature documentation when modifying business logic
- Update component documentation when changing UI components
- Update API documentation when modifying endpoints
- Update design principles when introducing new patterns

**For New Features:**
- Create new feature documentation in [`features/`](./features/)
- Document new components in [`components/`](./components/)
- Update [`app-overview.md`](./app-overview.md) with new capabilities
- Add todos to [`todos.md`](./todos.md) for follow-up work

**For Bug Fixes:**
- Update relevant documentation if the fix changes behavior
- Document new patterns or approaches used
- Update troubleshooting sections with solutions

#### Documentation Standards

**File Naming:**
- Use kebab-case for file names (`user-management.md`)
- Place feature docs in appropriate subdirectories
- Use descriptive names that match the feature/component

**Content Standards:**
- Include purpose and scope at the top of each document
- Provide code examples for implementation guidance
- Document both what to do AND what not to do
- Include troubleshooting sections for complex topics
- Use consistent formatting and markdown standards

**Linking:**
- Link between related documents using relative paths
- Reference specific sections when relevant
- Maintain bi-directional links where appropriate

#### Documentation Review Process

1. **Self-Review**: Check that documentation matches implementation
2. **Accuracy**: Verify all code examples work correctly  
3. **Completeness**: Ensure all aspects of changes are documented
4. **Clarity**: Write for future developers who weren't involved in the implementation
5. **Cross-References**: Update any other docs that reference changed behavior

### Documentation Tools

- **Markdown**: All documentation uses GitHub-flavored Markdown
- **Code Examples**: Include TypeScript/TSX examples with proper syntax highlighting
- **Diagrams**: Use Mermaid diagrams for complex relationships when needed
- **Screenshots**: Include UI screenshots for visual components when helpful

## üîç Finding Information

### Quick Reference
- **Architecture**: [`architecture/app-overview.md`](./architecture/app-overview.md)
- **Development**: [`development/workflow.md`](./development/workflow.md)
- **Permissions**: [`system/permissions.md`](./system/permissions.md)
- **UI Standards**: [`ui/ui-design-principles.md`](./ui/ui-design-principles.md)
- **Deployment**: [`system/deployment.md`](./system/deployment.md)
- **Current Work**: [`development/todos.md`](./development/todos.md)
- **Components**: [`components/selectors.md`](./components/selectors.md)

### Search Tips
- Use your editor's search functionality across all `.md` files
- Component names are typically documented in their respective files
- Business logic is documented in feature files
- Implementation patterns are in design principles

### Getting Help
- Check existing documentation first
- Reference similar implementations in the codebase
- Follow established patterns rather than creating new ones
- Ask for clarification when documentation is unclear
