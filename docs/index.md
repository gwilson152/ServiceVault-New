## üìù Documentation Maintenance

### Critical Requirement: Always Update Documentation

**When making changes to the codebase, updating documentation is NOT optional - it is required.**

#### Update Requirements

**For Code Changes:**
- Update relevant feature documentation when modifying business logic
- Update component documentation when changing UI components
- Update API documentation when modifying endpoints
- Update design principles when introducing new patterns

**For New Features:**
- Create new feature documentation in [`features/`](./features/)
- Document new components in [`components/`](./components/)
- Update [`app-overview.md`](./app-overview.md) with new capabilities
- Add todos to [`todos.md`](./todos.md) for follow-up work

**For Bug Fixes:**
- Update relevant documentation if the fix changes behavior
- Document new patterns or approaches used
- Update troubleshooting sections with solutions

#### Documentation Standards

**File Naming:**
- Use kebab-case for file names (`user-management.md`)
- Place feature docs in appropriate subdirectories
- Use descriptive names that match the feature/component

**Content Standards:**
- Include purpose and scope at the top of each document
- Provide code examples for implementation guidance
- Document both what to do AND what not to do
- Include troubleshooting sections for complex topics
- Use consistent formatting and markdown standards

**Linking:**
- Link between related documents using relative paths
- Reference specific sections when relevant
- Maintain bi-directional links where appropriate

#### Documentation Review Process

1. **Self-Review**: Check that documentation matches implementation
2. **Accuracy**: Verify all code examples work correctly  
3. **Completeness**: Ensure all aspects of changes are documented
4. **Clarity**: Write for future developers who weren't involved in the implementation
5. **Cross-References**: Update any other docs that reference changed behavior

### Documentation Tools

- **Markdown**: All documentation uses GitHub-flavored Markdown
- **Code Examples**: Include TypeScript/TSX examples with proper syntax highlighting
- **Diagrams**: Use Mermaid diagrams for complex relationships when needed
- **Screenshots**: Include UI screenshots for visual components when helpful
